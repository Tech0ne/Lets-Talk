# Lets-Talk

## What is it ?

---

Lets-Talk is a simple chat application.

It works on local networks, and use symetric AES encryption.

## How to install it ?

To install Lets-Talk, you simply need to clone this entire repo (`git clone https://github.com/Tech0ne/Lets-Talk`).

Next up, run the script coresponding to your distrib (I personaly prefer Ubuntu over Fedora, but, eh, some people wanna play it hard :eyes:)

    ./install_ubuntu.sh

The last thing you wanna do, not the easyest one, is to find friends to talk to, setup a password (Both clients need to have the same) and run the new `local_chat` command.

If you want to explore all the possibilities that this script offer, look at `local_chat --help` to see the help menu.

If you want to run that script using docker, build it, and then use :
    
    docker run -it -p YOUR_PORT lets-talk

Do not hesitate to give back any updates that I could add, and any issues using that script.

Please do not use that script to do anything stupid, or don't get caught, I'me not responsible.
